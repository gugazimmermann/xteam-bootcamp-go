## Part 1 - Module 4 Activity: makejson.go

Write a program which prompts the user to first enter a name, and then enter an address. Your program should create a map and add the name and address to the map using the keys “name” and “address”, respectively. Your program should use Marshal() to create a JSON object from the map, and then your program should print the JSON object.
